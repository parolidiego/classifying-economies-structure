# Clustering Economic Structure
This notebook aims to categorize each country’s economic structure through the use of unsupervised machine learning methods (PCA and clustering). 
Its main purpose is to try to find relevant patterns among different countries’ economic structures to see if some of the world’s economies share major characteristics.

It was produced as the first assignment for the course on Advanced Modelling in the Master in Computational Social Sciences at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

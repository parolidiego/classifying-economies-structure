# Clustering Economic Structure
This repository contains reproducible files for a project aiming to cluster countries' economic structures through the use of unsupervised machine learning methods (PCA and clustering). 
The main purpose of the project is to try to find relevant patterns among different countries’ economic structures to see if some of the world’s economies share major characteristics.

It was produced as the first assignment for the course on Advanced Modelling in the Master in Computational Social Sciences at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
